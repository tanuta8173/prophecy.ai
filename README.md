# prophecy.ai
Prophecy is a simple web app used to make a call to meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct model and generate prophecies using replicate API. Normally the prophecies will be open to interpretation just like prophets in the history, their prophecies can be vage on meaning until it's interpreted or associated to a fact or event. The same way we can do with prophecy.ai prophecies, they are simple but rich of historical and common events for interpretation.  Since this is limited to text generation and token prediction with certain parameters adjusted for the output format, the more context we provide on our questions the better will be the provided results. Feel free to test the ancient wisdom of the oracle here:
